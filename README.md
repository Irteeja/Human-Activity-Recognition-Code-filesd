CSI-Based Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
A Hybrid Deep Learning Framework Using Real & Augmented WiFi CSI Data with CNN + Transformer Architecture


📝 Overview
This repository contains the full implementation of a privacy-preserving Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). The project integrates signal preprocessing, statistical feature extraction, deep learning models, and advanced data augmentation to classify 16 real-world human activities in both single-user and multi-user settings.

📌 Key Highlight: A novel CNN + Transformer architecture combined with domain-specific augmentation and handcrafted features for robust HAR.

🔍 Project Highlights
💡 Problem: Traditional HAR approaches using wearables or cameras raise privacy and scalability issues.

🎯 Goal: Recognize human activities using CSI data passively, accurately, and scalably.

🧠 Solution:

Butterworth Filtering + Discrete Wavelet Transform

Augmentation: Jittering, Scaling, Slicing, Window Warping

Feature Extraction: Time, Frequency, Entropy domains

Hybrid Models: CNN + Transformer, RF, SVM, KNN, MLP

Evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation across 16 activities.
